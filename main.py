#   NOOFCHARACTERS: The number of characters in the password. If unknown, enter -1; this will test every combination of one   #
#  character, then every combination of two characters, then three, etc. Be careful, this can easily start an infinite loop   #
#                                               with an incorrect character set.                                              #
#    CHARACTERSET: The character set(s) to use. Use A to test upper case letters, a to test lower case letters, n to test     # 
#   numbers and s to test special characters. You can use any combination of A, a, n and s, e.g. A, s, sa, Aans, snaA, etc.   #
#                                       -v: verbose mode (outputs word being attempted)                                       #

#   KNOWN ISSUES: In verbose mode, it sometimes outputs the word it's trying to crack the zip file with twice. This doesn't   #
